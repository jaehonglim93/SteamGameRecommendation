Our project is a web application that provides recommendations on games published in the Steam store.

The recommendations will be based on information that the user has provided and then the website will compare the information with the given Steam database.

It will give the names and other basic information of games that have the most common features.

Furthermore, the site will be able to connect players together by providing Steam user IDs based on similar preferences and interests.
